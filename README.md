#Urban Heat Island Effect in Boston: Data Analysis & Modeling

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose & Motivation
As urban environments grow, they experience rising temperatures, a phenomenon known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. In cities like Boston, dense construction, minimal vegetation, and high energy consumption contribute significantly to this effect. This study aims to explore the intricate relationship between urbanization and temperature rise using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.

The project seeks to:

Analyze the key contributors to the UHI effect in Boston.
Uncover nonlinear relationships between land surface temperature and city features.
Provide actionable insights for sustainable city development and climate mitigation strategies.
1.2 Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis originates from the Harvard Dataverse and includes records pertaining to the UHI effect in Boston. The dataset contains 24,719 records across 14 columns, and is provided in a CSV format.

The dataset comprises various layers of data, including geospatial information obtained from sources such as Landsat and MassGIS. These layers were organized into a raster stack file for spatial analysis.
