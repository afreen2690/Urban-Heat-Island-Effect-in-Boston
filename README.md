# Urban Heat Island Effect in Boston: Data Analysis & Modeling

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose & Motivation
As urban environments expand, they experience rising temperatures, a phenomenon known as the **Urban Heat Island (UHI)** effect. In cities like Boston, dense construction, limited vegetation, and high energy consumption contribute significantly to this effect. This project aims to explore the relationship between urbanization and temperature rise using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.

The goals of this project are:
- To analyze key contributors to the UHI effect in Boston.
- To reveal nonlinear relationships between land surface temperature and city features.
- To provide actionable insights for sustainable city development and climate mitigation strategies.

### 1.2 Dataset
The dataset used for this project originates from the **Harvard Dataverse** and contains **24,719 records across 14 columns**. It is in CSV format and includes various layers of geospatial data sourced from platforms like **Landsat** and **MassGIS**.

Each data layer represents different attributes of the city, such as land surface temperature, building density, and vegetation cover, which are used to assess the UHI effect.
